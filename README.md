## Predicting Hours of Sleep using Facebook Prophet Model
The repository contains the Facebook Prophet Model fit on a year of generated time series data to predict hours of sleep. This code exemplifies and visualizes a basic implementation of the model that can be expanded to several use cases.

Files: 
- generate_data.py: Uses several parameters to create and generate prophet_vals.csv containing the data frame with date and hours
- model.py: Fits the generated data with the Prophet model and displays predictions along with graph visualizations
- prophet_vals.csv
